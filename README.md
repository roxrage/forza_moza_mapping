# Forza - Moza Mapping Config Files

# IMPORTANT! You have to remap your controls in game after replacing the config file! Otherwise it will not work!

## Forza Horizon 5

Moza or MSFT introduced a bug in Forza Horizon 5 on 25th of April 2025 which has several issues with the Moza Steering Wheel button mapping.

Issue 1:

The car will rev constantly in tuning menu. The mapping of "Tab" is mapped to axis 0 which is steering and therefore is never zero so it revs.

Issue 2:

In race the button "A" is hardcode mapped to "look_straight_backwards" which is annoying if you remap buttons in game and hardcoded mapping is not overridden.

Since I was annoyed about this, I checked the config files and changed it.

## Forza Motorsport 8

Also I had major issues with the button mapping in FM8, where it would not be saved, i could not use D-Pad for navigation in menu etc. so I also made a profile for this game.

## Installation

To use this config file for your Moza Steering Wheel, download the file and copy it to:

Here is a short video of how to install and remap the controls:
